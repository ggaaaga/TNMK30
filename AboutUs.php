				<h1> About us </h1> 

					<p>Our team of programers consists of four members with the common goal of creating an easy to use interface for the collectors of LEGO®.
					</p>

				<h2>LEGO®</h2>
					<p> LEGO® is a block building toy that has been around since 1932.
					As of 2021 LEGO® is the largest toy company in the world. 
					The legos consist of variously colored interlocking bricks, mini figures and even in some cases gears.
					Legos give young kids the oportuninty to improve their creativity and motor skills at a young age. 
					Although each set has a specified young age they always say that their toys can be enjoyed by people as old as 99,
					ofcourse this doesn't mean that once you turn 100 you have to throw all your legos away this is simply a recognition
					by the LEGO® company to the many collectors who purchase legos well into adulthood. 
					
				<h2> The Project </h2>
					<p>
					The project went through the typical stages of development. 
					The planing stage where the mind map was created and also where the colors that would be used in the website were chosen.
					We had decided to go for the primary colors that we and probably most other people remember when they think of Lego which is primaraly red and blue.
					We thought that is most fitting for a website of this kind. Thereafter it was time to create the search function and the HTML and CSS. 
					To make the work a bit easier we devided the group in two, letting one group create the looks and then the other create the search function.
					After that it came time to join the two files together and to test that everything was working as it should. 
					Once the website was complete there was only the report left.
